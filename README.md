User sign-up and sign-in operations in the project are done using firebase and nuxt.js. I made this project while learning nuxt.js. <br> <br>
Note: Firebase config information must be entered in the firebase.js file located under the Services folder.
## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
